It's a great book to learn the basis of computer programming.

This books teachs us about the main foundations of computer science, including computer thinking, numbers and types, loops, decisions (if/else), vector, matrices, functions, memory, and more.

# Motivation

Learning how to program is not easy. But this book tries to make it easier and easier.

Starting from chapter 3, we are presented with a deep explanation from each topic and then several solved examples. After this, the book has many proposed problems for the student to solve.

My answers for those problem are available in this repository.

# Build status

I have done chapter 5 and now starting chapter 6 (vectors).

# Tech/framework used

I'm using Python3 to solve the book's problems.
